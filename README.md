## ðŸš€ How to execute:
- Clone the repository using git clone
- Install the dependencies (Django)
- Change to commerce directory using ```cd commerce```
- Run ```python manage.py runserver```
- That will make django start the application on your machine and you will receive a message like this one:
```Watching for file changes with StatReloader
